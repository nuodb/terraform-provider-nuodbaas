# nuodbaas_backuppolicy (Data Source)

Data source for exposing information about NuoDB backup policies created using the DBaaS Control Plane

## Example Usage

# Data source that returns the attributes of a specific backup policy
data "nuodbaas_backuppolicy" "policy_details" {
  organization = nuodbaas_backuppolicy.pol.organization
  name         = nuodbaas_backuppolicy.pol.name
}
```
